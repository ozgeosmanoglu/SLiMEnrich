#### Predicted DMIs

This tab shows the actual DMIs that are identified (when restricting to known ELM interactions) or predicted in the PPI dataset through mapping `mProtein` and `dProtein` PPI pairs to `mProtein`-`dProtein` pairs in the set of [Potential DMIs](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/wiki/Analysis-and-Outputs/#potential) (i.e. all possible DMIs. For more details of how mapping is done, refer to [Input Data Mapping](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/wiki/SLiMEnrich-Schema#input-data-mapping). By default, all possible links will be shown. To reduce to the set of non-redundant `mProtein`-`dProtein` pairs used for calculations, check the **Show NR predicted DMI** box.
