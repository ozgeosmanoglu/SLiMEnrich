#### Uploaded Data

This tab shows the content of the four uploaded files used for analysis: PPIs, DMI, Motifs and Domains. (**NOTE:** for **elmiprot** and **elmcprot** strategies, the Motif and/or Domain file will have been made from the DMI file.) Unless user files are selected for upload, these will be the relevant files from [`data/`](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/tree/master/data). For human PPI data, the user need only load their PPI data and press **LOAD DATA**. In the absence of a PPI file, the example PPI data from [`data/`](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/tree/master/data) will be used. By default, the full file contents will be shown in the tables. Checking the **Show parsed data columns** box will display which data have been parsed from each input file for the later stages (e.g. what data is being used for `mProtein`, `Motif`, `Domain` and `dProtein`).
