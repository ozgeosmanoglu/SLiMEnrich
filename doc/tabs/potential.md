### Potential DMIs

This tab shows all possible DMIs for the loaded PPI data by mapping all possibe `mProtein`-`Motif`-`Domain`-`dProtein` links from the loaded data, where `mProtein` and `dProtein` are both found in the PPI data, but not necessarily interacting with each other. This represents the overall pool of the DMIs, given the proteins (but ignoring the actual interactions) in the PPI data. For more details of how mapping is done, refer to [Input Data Mapping](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/wiki/SLiMEnrich-Schema#input-data-mapping).
