#### Predicted DMI Network

This tab generates a visualisation of the [predicted DMI](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/wiki/Analysis-and-Outputs/#predicted) network. Different network layouts can be selected and the network can be explored by dragging and moving nodes. Colours match those used in the [summary](https://github.com/slimsuite/SLiMEnrich/wiki/Analysis-and-Outputs/#summary) tab.

**NOTE:** SLiMEnrich will display whatever identifiers have been used for DMI mapping. (ELM, Pfam and Uniprot by default.) For accessible network labels, please use accessible input data, e.g. HGNC gene symbols for `mProtein` and `dProtein` fields. Due to the inherent risks of errors and failing to keep up-to-date, SLiMEnrich does not perform any identifier mapping.
